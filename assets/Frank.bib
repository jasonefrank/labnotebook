	Abstract = {Point vortex models are frequently encountered in conceptual studies in geophysical fluid dynamics, but also in practical applications, for instance, in aeronautics. In spherical geometry, the motion of vortex centres is governed by a dynamical system with a known Poisson structure. We construct Poisson integration methods for these dynamics by splitting the Hamiltonian into its constituent vortex pair terms. From backward error analysis, the method is formally known to provide solutions to a modified Poisson system with the correct bracket, but with a modified Hamiltonian function. Different orderings of the pairwise interactions are considered and also used for the construction of higher order methods. The energy and momentum conservation of the splitting schemes is demonstrated for several test cases. For particular orderings of the pairwise interactions, the schemes allow scalable parallelization. This results in a linear--as opposed to quadratic--scaling of computation time with system size when scaling the number of processors accordingly.},

	Abstract = {We explore the direct modification of the pseudo-spectral truncation of two-dimensional, incompressible fluid dynamics to maintain a prescribed kinetic energy spectrum. The method provides a means of simulating fluid states with defined spectral properties, for the purpose of matching simulation statistics to given information, arising from observations, theoretical prediction or high-fidelity simulation. In the scheme outlined here, Nos{\'e}--Hoover thermostats, commonly used in molecular dynamics, are introduced as feedback controls applied to energy shells of the Fourier-discretized Navier--Stokes equations. As we demonstrate in numerical experiments, the dynamical properties (quantified using autocorrelation functions) are only modestly perturbed by our device, while ensemble dispersion is significantly enhanced compared with simulations of a corresponding truncation incorporating hyperviscosity.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we propose a state estimation method for linear parabolic partial differential equations (PDE) that accounts for errors in the model, truncation, and observations. It is based on an extension of the Galerkin projection method. The extended method models projection coefficients, representing the state of the PDE in some basis, by means of a differential-algebraic equation (DAE). The original estimation problem for the PDE is then recast as a state estimation problem for the constructed DAE using a linear continuous minimax filter. We construct a numerical time integrator that preserves the monotonic decay of a nonstationary Lyapunov function along the solution. To conclude, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method by applying it to the tracking of a discharged pollutant slick in a two-dimensional fluid.},

	Abstract = {A key challenge for an efficient splitting technique is defining the importance function. If the rare event set consists of multiple separated subsets this challenge becomes bigger since the most likely path to the rare event set may be very different from the most likely path to an intermediate level. We propose to mitigate this problem of path deviation by estimating the subset probabilities separately using a modified splitting technique. We compare the proposed separated splitting technique with a standard splitting technique by estimating the probability of entering either of two separated intervals on the real line. The squared relative error of the estimator is shown to be significantly higher when using standard splitting than when using separated splitting. We show that this difference increases if the rare event probability becomes smaller, illustrating the advantage of the separated splitting technique.},

	Abstract = {As intermittent renewable energy penetrates electrical power grids more and more, assessing grid reliability is of increasing concern for grid operators. Monte Carlo simulation is a robust and popular technique to estimate indices for grid reliability, but the involved computational intensity may be too high for typical reliability analyses. We show that various reliability indices can be expressed as expectations depending on the rare event probability of a so-called power curtailment, and explain how to extend a Crude Monte Carlo grid reliability analysis with an existing rare event splitting technique. The squared relative error of index estimators can be controlled, whereas orders of magnitude less workload is required than when using an equivalent Crude Monte Carlo method. We show further that a bad choice for the time step size or for the importance function may endanger this squared relative error.},

In this work, we augment a given approximate model with a control law (a ``thermostat'') that gently perturbs the dynamical system to target a thermodynamic state consistent with a set of prescribed (possibly evolving) observations. As proof of concept, we provide an example involving a point vortex fluid model on the sphere, for which we show convergence of equilibrium quantities (in the stationary case) and the ability of the thermostat to dynamically track a transient state.},

	Abstract = {In this article we develop algorithms for data assimilation based upon a computational time dependent stable/unstable splitting. Our particular method is based upon shadowing refinement and synchronization techniques and is motivated by work on Assimilation in the Unstable Subspace (AUS) and Pseudo-orbit Data Assimilation (PDA). The algorithm utilizes time dependent projections onto the non-stable subspace determined by employing computational techniques for Lyapunov exponents/vectors. The method is extended to parameter estimation without changing the problem dynamics and we address techniques for adapting the method when (as is commonly the case) observations are not available in the full model state space. We use a combination of analysis and numerical experiments (with the Lorenz 63 and Lorenz 96 models) to illustrate the efficacy of the techniques and show that the results compare favorably with other variational techniques.},

This state equation is subject to uncertain but bounded noise in the input (Kolmogorov forcing) and initial conditions, and its output is incomplete and contains bounded noise. The algorithm designs a time-dependent gain such that the estimation error converges to zero exponentially. The sufficient condition for the existence of the gain are formulated in the form of algebraic Riccati equations. To demonstrate the results we apply the proposed algorithm to the reconstruction a chaotic fluid flow from incomplete and noisy data.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we propose a new sequential data assimilation method for non-linear ordinary differential equations with compact state space. The method is designed so that the Lyapunov exponents of the corresponding estimation error dynamics are negative, i.e. the estimation error decays exponentially fast. The latter is shown to be the case for generic regular flow maps if and only if the observation matrix H satisfies detectability conditions: the rank of H must be at least as great as the number of nonnegative Lyapunov exponents of the underlying attractor. Numerical experiments illustrate the exponential convergence of the method and the sharpness of the theory for the case of Lorenz96 and Burgers equations with incomplete and noisy observations.},

@article{FrGo18,
	Abstract = {A minimal requirement for simulating multi-scale systems is to reproduce the statistical behavior of the slow variables. In particular, a good numerical method should accurately aproximate the probability density function of the continuous-time slow variables. In this note we use results from homogenization and from backward error analysis to quantify how errors of time integrators affect the mean behavior of trajectories. We show that numerical simulations converge, not to the exact probability density function (pdf) of the homogenized multi-scale system, but rather to that of the homogenized modified equations following from backward error analysis. Using homogenization theory we find that the observed statistical bias is exacerbated for multi-scale systems driven by fast chaotic dynamics that decorrelate insufficiently rapidly. This suggests that to resolve the statistical behavior of trajectories in certain multi-scale systems solvers of sufficiently high order are necessary. Alternatively, backward error analysis suggests the form of an amended vector field that corrects the lowest order bias in Euler's method. The resulting scheme, a second order Taylor method, avoids any statistical drift bias. We corroborate our analysis with a numerical example.},

We provide results of tests of the method in the plane, results from incorporating the advection method into a semi‐Lagrangian method for the rotating shallow‐water equations in planar geometry, and results from extending the method to the surface of a sphere.},

	Abstract = {We develop a hydrostatic Hamiltonian particle‐mesh (HPM) method for efficient long‐term numerical integration of the atmosphere. In the HPM method, the hydrostatic approximation is interpreted as a holonomic constraint for the vertical position of particles. This can be viewed as defining a set of vertically buoyant horizontal meshes, with the altitude of each mesh point determined so as to satisfy the hydrostatic balance condition and with particles modelling horizontal advection between the moving meshes. We implement the method in a vertical‐slice model and evaluate its performance for the simulation of idealized linear and nonlinear orographic flow in both dry and moist environments. The HPM method is able to capture the basic features of the gravity wave to a degree of accuracy comparable with that reported in the literature. The numerical solution in the moist experiment indicates that the influence of moisture on wave characteristics is represented reasonably well and the reduction of momentum flux is in good agreement with theoretical analysis.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a probabilistic power flow model subject to connection temperature constraints. Renewable power generation is included and modelled stochastically in order to reflect its intermittent nature. In contrast to conventional models that enforce connection current constraints, short-term current overloading is allowed. Temperature constraints are weaker than current constraints, and hence the proposed model quantifies the overload risk more realistically. Using such a constraint is justified the more by the intermittent nature of the renewable power source.
Allowing temporary current overloading necessitates the incor- poration of a time domain in our model. This substantially influences the choice of model for the renewable power source, as we explain. Wind power is modelled by use of an ARMA model, and appropriate accelerations of the power flow solution technique are chosen. Several IEEE test case examples illustrate the more realistic risk analysis. An example shows that a current constraint model may overestimate these risks, which may lead to unnecessary over-investments by grid operators in grid connections.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we solve two initial value problems for two-dimensional internal gravity waves. The waves are contained in a uniformly stratified, square-shaped domain whose sidewalls are tilted with respect to the direction of gravity. We consider several disturbances of the initial stream function field and solve both for its free evolution and for its evolution under parametric excitation. We do this by developing a structure-preserving numerical method for internal gravity waves in a two-dimensional stratified fluid domain. We recall the linearized, inviscid Euler--Boussinesq model, identify its Hamiltonian structure, and derive a staggered finite difference scheme that preserves this structure. For the discretized model, the initial condition can be projected onto normal modes whose dynamics is described by independent harmonic oscillators. This fact is used to explain the persistence of various classes of wave attractors in a freely evolving (i.e. unforced) flow. Under parametric forcing, the discrete dynamics can likewise be decoupled into Mathieu equations. The most unstable resonant modes dominate the solution, forming wave attractors.},

	Abstract = {Thermal bath coupling mechanisms as utilized in molecular dynamics are applied to partial differential equation models. Working from a semi-discrete (Fourier mode) formulation for the Burgers--Hopf or Korteweg--de Vries equation, we introduce auxiliary variables and stochastic perturbations in order to drive the system to sample a target ensemble which may be a Gibbs state or, more generally, any smooth distribution defined on a constraint manifold. We examine the ergodicity of approaches based on coupling of the heat bath to the high wave numbers, with the goal of controlling the ensemble through the fast modes. We also examine different thermostat methods in the extent to which dynamical properties are corrupted in order to accurately compute the average of a desired observable with respect to the invariant distribution. The principal observation of this paper is that convergence to the invariant distribution can be achieved by thermostatting just the highest wave number, while the evolution of the slowest modes is little affected by such a thermostat.},

Subdomain deflation is very easy to implement and has been parallelized on a distributed memory system with only a small amount of additional communication.

Two new integrators are derived and compared, including (1) a symmetric energy and spin-length preserving integrator based on a Red-Black splitting of the spin sites combined with a staggered timestepping scheme and (2) a (Lie-Poisson) symplectic integrator based on Hamiltonian splitting. The methods are applied to both 1D and 2D lattice models and are compared with the commonly used explicit Runge--Kutta, projected Runge--Kutta, and implicit midpoint schemes on the bases of accuracy, conservation of invariants and computational expense. It is shown that while any of the symmetry-preserving schemes improves the integration of the dynamics of solitons or vortex pairs compared to Runge-Kutta or projected Runge Kutta methods, the staggered Red-Black scheme is far more efficient than the other alternatives.},

We assume that a finite restricted system can be modelled by a generalized canonical ensemble, described by a density which is a smooth function of the energy of the restricted system. A thermostat is constructed to continuously perturb the resolved dynamics, while leaving the desired equilibrium distribution invariant. We build on a thermostatting framework developed and tested in the setting of molecular dynamics, using stochastic perturbations to control (and stabilize) the invariant measure. We also apply these techniques in the setting of a simplified point vortex flow on a disc, in which a modified Gibbs distribution (modelling a finite, rather than infinite, bath of weak vortices) provides a regularizing formulation for restricted system dynamics. Numerical experiments, effectively replacing many vortices by a few artificial degrees of freedom, are in excellent agreement with the two-scale simulations of B{\"u}hler [Phys.

	Abstract = {Multisymplectic methods have recently been proposed as a generalization of symplectic ODE methods to the case of Hamiltonian PDEs. Their excellent long time behavior for a variety of Hamiltonian wave equations has been demonstrated in a number of numerical studies. A theoretical investigation and justification of multisymplectic methods is still largely missing. In this paper, we study linear multisymplectic PDEs and their discretization by means of numerical dispersion relations. It is found that multisymplectic methods in the sense of Bridges and Reich Phys. Lett. A, 284 (2001), pp. 184-193] and Reich J. Comput. Phys., 157 (2000), pp. 473-499], such as Gauss-Legendre Runge-Kutta methods, possess a number of desirable properties such as nonexistence of spurious roots and conservation of the sign of the group velocity. A certain CFL-type restriction on $\Delta t/\Delta x$ might be required for methods higher than second order in time. It is also demonstrated by means of the explicit midpoint method that multistep methods may exhibit spurious roots in the numerical dispersion relation for any value of $\Delta t/\Delta x$ despite being multisymplectic in the sense of discrete variational mechanics [J. E. Marsden, G. P. Patrick, and S. Shkoller, Commun. Math. Phys., 199 (1999), pp. 351-395].},

	Abstract = {In this paper we discuss the conservation of wave action under numerical discretization by variational and multisymplectic methods. Both the abstract wave action conservation defined with respect to a smooth, periodic, one-parameter ensemble of flow realizations and the specific wave action based on an approximated and averaged Lagrangian are addressed in the numerical context. It is found that the discrete variational formulation gives rise in a natural way not only to the discrete wave action conservation law, but also to a generalization of the numerical dispersion relation to the case of variable coefficients. Indeed a fully discrete analogue of the modulation equations arises. On the other hand, the multisymplectic framework gives easy access to the conservation law for the general class of multisymplectic Runge--Kutta methods. A numerical experiment confirms conservation of wave action to machine precision and suggests that the solution of the discrete modulation equations approximates the numerical solution to order ${\cal O}(\varepsilon)$  on intervals of ${\cal O}(\varepsilon^{-1})$},

	Abstract = {We develop a particle-mesh method for two-layer shallow-water equations subject to the rigid-lid approximation. The method is based on the recently proposed Hamiltonian particle-mesh (HPM) method and the interpretation of the rigid-lid approximation as a set of holonomic constraints. The suggested spatial discretization leads to a constrained Hamiltonian system of ODEs which is integrated in time using a variant of the symplectic SHAKE/RATTLE algorithm. It is demonstrated that the elimination of external gravity waves by the rigid-lid approximation can be achieved in a computationally stable and efficient way.},

	Abstract = {The Landau--Lifshitz equation (LLE) governing the flow of magnetic spin in a ferromagnetic material is a PDE with a noncanonical Hamiltonian structure. In this paper we derive a number of new formulations of the LLE as a partial differential equation on a multisymplectic structure. Using this form we show that the standard central spatial discretization of the LLE gives a semi-discrete multisymplectic PDE, and suggest an efficient symplectic splitting method for time integration. Furthermore we introduce a new space--time box scheme discretization which satisfies a discrete local conservation law for energy flow, implicit in the LLE, and made transparent by the multisymplectic framework.},

	Abstract = {Kelvin's circulation theorem and its implications for potential vorticity (PV) conservation are among the most fundamental concepts in ideal fluid dynamics. In this note, we discuss the numerical treatment of these concepts with the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) and related methods. We show that SPH satisfies an exact circulation theorem in an interpolated velocity field, and that, when appropriately interpreted, this leads to statements of conservation of PV and generalized enstrophies. We also indicate some limitations where the analogy with ideal fluid dynamics breaks down.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we outline a new particle-mesh method for rapidly rotating shallow water flows based on a set of regularized equations of motion. The time-stepping method uses an operator splitting of the equations into an Eulerian gravity wave part and a Lagrangian advection part. An essential ingredient is the advection of absolute vorticity by means of translated radial basis functions. We show that this implies exact conservation of enstrophy. The method is tested on two model problems based on the qualitative features of the solutions obtained (i.e., dispersion or smoothness of potential vorticity contours) as well as on the increase in mean divergence level.},
